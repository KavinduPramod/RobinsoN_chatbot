# Robinson Chatbot

![Logo](mylogo.png)

## Description
This is a simple chatbot created using the OpenAI API. The front-end development was done using HTML and CSS, while JavaScript was used for other aspects. Please note that due to OpenAI restrictions, the chatbot might not work as expected during the testing stage.

## Folder Structure
There are two main folders in this project:

- `client`: Contains all the front-end components.
- `server`: Handles the back-end functionality.

## Resources
I found the JavaScript Mastery YouTube channel to be very helpful in developing this chatbot. You can access the specific video I used for reference by clicking [here](https://youtu.be/2FeymQoKvrk).
